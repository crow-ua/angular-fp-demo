# Angular + FP Demo

Angular can be very similar to React! Well... almost.

The app features:
* CLI - based
* Angular Material 2
* Redux via Ngrx
* Hot Module Replacement
* Persist the state in the local storage and auto-rehydrate
* Example authentication with Guards
* Angular Reactive Forms
* Example use of async pipe

## Development

Execute `yarn install` or `npm install` to download everything needed.
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
